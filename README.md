# San Francisco Housing Project
In this project I analyzed data from San Francisco and used visualization to convey what the data was telling. Hvplot and Geoviews were used to discover what neighboohds from 2010 - 2016 were on the rise in rent and sales cost per square square foot. This gave insight into an analysis that can be developed for future investors.
